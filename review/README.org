#+title: Building Review
The review can be built with Emacs and some sort of latex compiler.

Open the file with emacs with the following Command:

#+begin_src sh
$ emacs review.org
#+end_src

With the following Key sequence, the org transpiler will be invoked
and if =pdflatex= is present in the path, it will create and open the
final pdf: =<Ctrl>+<c> <Ctrl>-<e> <l> <o>= or in emacs notation: =C-c
C-e l o=.

Org-mode is part of the standard emacs distribution.
