* dlisp
Dlisp is a not very standard lisp implementation. Dlisp is implemented
in Rust and uses no unsafe blocks.

#+begin_src lisp
(set (quote first-var) 420)
(set (quote second-var) (+ first-var 69))
(print second-var)
#+end_src

As seen in this example, the syntax is very barebones and does not
support convenience features like singlequotes for symbols or dots for
cons cells.

* Flags
The flags that are given to the program are automatically split into
lisp code and flags for the lisp environment.

A file can be read with the =-f= flag.

* Building
The Project can be run with the following commands:

#+begin_src 
$ git clone https://www.github.com/domse007/dlisp
$ cargo build --release
