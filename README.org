* dlisp
Dlisp is a not very standard lisp implementation. Dlisp is implemented
in Rust and uses no unsafe blocks.

#+begin_src lisp
(set (quote first-var) 420)
(set (quote second-var) (+ first-var 69))
(print second-var)
#+end_src

As seen in this example, the syntax is very barebones and does not
support convenience features like singlequotes for symbols or dots for
cons cells. 

#+begin_src lisp
(defun test-2 ()
   (set (quote other) (+ 6 5))
   (print (+ (quote other) 2)))

(defun test ()
   (set (quote this) 12)
   (test-2)
   (print (quote this)))

(test)
#+end_src

* Flags
The flags that are given to the program are automatically split into
lisp code and flags for the lisp environment.

A file can be read with the =-f= flag.

* Building
The Project can be run with the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
$ git clone https://www.github.com/domse007/dlisp
$ cd dlisp
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/dlisp -f dlisp/out.dl
#+end_src

The tests can be run with the following command:

#+begin_src sh
$ cargo test
#+end_src
